# NyxAPI

NyxAPI is a mock API platform that accelerates frontend development by simulating APIs, allowing developers to work independently of backend readiness. It helps streamline workflows by providing customizable endpoints, realistic responses, and early API contract definitions.

## Key Features

- **Mock API Generation**: Quickly create mock APIs with flexible response types.
- **Frontend-Backend Parallelism**: Enables independent frontend development.
- **Realistic Simulations**: Test with simulated API responses (success, error, large datasets).
- **API Contracts**: Ensure consistent and well-defined API agreements between teams.
- **Versioning**: Test compatibility with versioned APIs.

## Benefits

- **Speed Up Development**: Frontend teams can integrate without waiting for backend completion.
- **Test API Responses**: Handle edge cases like errors and empty data scenarios.
- **Consistent Environment**: Reliable, stable mock APIs for consistent testing.
- **Collaboration**: Improves team communication with predefined API contracts.
- **Third-Party API Simulation**: Mock external APIs for integration testing.

## Use Cases

- **Frontend Integration**: Start API integration early.
- **Edge Case Testing**: Simulate various API responses to validate error handling.
- **Load Testing**: Simulate performance scenarios with large datasets or delays.
- **Third-Party API Testing**: Simulate external service integrations.

## Get Started

Set up mock API endpoints, define expected responses, and start testing.
